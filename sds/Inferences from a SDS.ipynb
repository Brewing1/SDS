    "- In this reduced example above, we had to run the DDS 70*35 = 2450 times (70 times for each of the 35 possible hands south was holding). This very quickly becomes infeasible for problems with more cards than this. Note, however, that this SDS is 'complete', in that it calculates every possible layout, and does not reduce the size of the game tree (except for alpha-beta pruning). Reducing the game tree size is where the crux of the SDS is, and the use of heuristics created manually and learned from ILP/PILP will greatly help if integrated in this system.\n",
    "- This strategy is only one-step. If North knows that West is employing this strategy, they can use that to aid their decisions. Moreover, if South knew that West would be employing this strategy, they could exploit it in their leading strategy. Thus, finding a true nash equilibrium is infeasible - but working towards one with heuristic simplifications could provide nice gains  \n",
    "- Looking at the above point another way - while taking inference from the play can be hard, once it's taken, you can reduce the search tree size (we only searched 16 layouts in this example instead of the original 35). Although, you may want to still explore the whole tree and just give probabilistic weightings to our inferences.\n",
    "- When playing against humans or a another AI, we won't be as certain about how they make their decisions, and so we are susceptible to being misled about their possible ranges. This is where assigning a probability to the inferences could be crucial\n"
